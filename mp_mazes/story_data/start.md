After nailing his interview with Facebook, Mark makes his way towards the exit when a hissing noise catches his attention. Its a slightly cracked open door with nothing but a red emergency light marking the way. Curiosity takes over Mark and he ventures into the room. It's large, poorly lit storage room. Mark can hear the hissing get louder to his left. Its behind a large metal door with a keypad on it. In front of him is a shelf with maintenance supplies and to his right is a bundle of cardboard boxes.
