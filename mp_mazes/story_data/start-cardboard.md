The cardboard boxes seem to be full of junk. Mark notices a few shed snake skins here and there and a trophy with glowing eyes and the name "Sheryl Sandberg" on the plaque. He inspects the trophy further and notices a date on it. "4/7/18". Believing this date could be important, he writes it down. Mark can now once more head towards the door or check out the shelf.

# start-cardboard-hissing
Mark heads straight towards the keypad, ignoring the maintenance shelf.
